Nowadays, medicine has made huge steps forward, there are still many health problems that are not completely solved. One of those and probably the most major one is the disease of cancer. This was the reason why I decided to make a project to predict breast cancer, a form of cancer that causes the death of 670,000 women annually. \\~\\
So to solve the problem I decided to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python and train it properly on a database with histopathology images. The agent is used to process those images and then predict the state of the patients health, more specifically if they are positive or negative in the disease of breast cancer.
